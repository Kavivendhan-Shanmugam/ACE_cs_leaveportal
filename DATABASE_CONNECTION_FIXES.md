# Database Connection Issues - Fixed

## Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. **Database Configuration Inconsistencies**
- **Problem**: Different database configurations between development and production servers
- **Solution**: Updated `backend/config/database.js` to use consistent configuration with proper fallback values
- **Changes**: Added environment variable loading check and better debugging output

### 2. **Production Server Database Config**
- **Problem**: Production server was creating its own dbConfig instead of using the shared configuration
- **Solution**: Updated `backend/server.production.js` to import and use `dbConfig` from the shared config file
- **Changes**: Removed duplicate database configuration and added connection pool initialization logging

### 3. **Environment Variable Loading**
- **Problem**: Environment variables weren't being loaded consistently across different environments
- **Solution**: Added proper dotenv configuration loading in the database config module
- **Changes**: Enhanced environment variable detection and loading with fallback mechanisms

### 4. **Frontend API URL Configuration**
- **Problem**: Hardcoded API URLs and inconsistent environment variable usage
- **Solution**: Updated `src/utils/apiClient.ts` to properly use environment variables with debugging
- **Changes**: Added console logging for API configuration and improved error handling

### 5. **Database Connection Pool Settings**
- **Problem**: Invalid MySQL2 connection options causing warnings
- **Solution**: Updated database config with proper MySQL2-compatible options
- **Changes**: Added proper connection pooling settings and removed unsupported options

## Test Results

### Database Connection Test ✅
- ✅ Database connection established successfully
- ✅ Basic queries working
- ✅ All required tables exist (except 'batches' - needs migration)
- ✅ Connection pool working with concurrent connections

### Backend API Test ✅
- ✅ Production server starts successfully
- ✅ Health endpoint responding correctly
- ✅ Authentication endpoint working
- ✅ Database connectivity verified

## Current Configuration

### Database Settings
```
Host: localhost
Port: 3307
Database: cyber_security_leave_portal
User: root
Password: [Set from environment variables]
```

### API Endpoints
- Production API: `http://210.212.246.131:3009`
- Health Check: `/health`
- Authentication: `/api/auth/login`

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Create Batches Table**: The 'batches' table is missing and needs to be created
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all environment variables are properly set in production
3. **Frontend Testing**: Test the frontend dashboard connection to the fixed backend
4. **SSL Configuration**: Consider adding SSL/HTTPS for production deployment

## Files Modified

1. `backend/config/database.js` - Enhanced database configuration
2. `backend/server.production.js` - Fixed database configuration import
3. `src/utils/apiClient.ts` - Improved API URL configuration
4. `.env.local` - Updated local development settings

## Test Scripts Created

1. `test-database-connection.js` - Comprehensive database connectivity test
2. `test-backend-api.js` - Backend API endpoints test

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The database and dashboard connection issues have been successfully resolved. The backend can now properly connect to the database, and the frontend is configured to connect to the correct API endpoints.
