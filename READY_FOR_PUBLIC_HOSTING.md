# 🚀 **ACE CSS Leave Portal - READY FOR PUBLIC HOSTING!**

## ✅ **PREPARATION COMPLETED**

Your Leave Portal system has been **fully prepared** for public hosting on your college server! All the necessary files, configurations, and scripts have been created.

---

## 📋 **What You Need to Do Next**

### **🔥 STEP 1: Run the Preparation Script (Do This First!)**

**On your current Windows system:**
```powershell
# Execute the PowerShell preparation script
.\Prepare-Production.ps1
```

**When prompted, enter your college server's public IP address.**

This script will:
- ✅ Build the production version of your app
- ✅ Create all environment configurations
- ✅ Set up deployment scripts
- ✅ Generate Linux management tools
- ✅ Configure PM2 ecosystem
- ✅ Prepare database scripts

### **📁 STEP 2: Copy to Your College Server**

1. **Copy the ENTIRE project folder** to your Linux college server
2. Recommended location: `/var/www/leave-portal/` or `/home/yourusername/leave-portal/`
3. Ensure you have SSH access and sudo privileges

### **⚡ STEP 3: Deploy on Your College Server**

**SSH into your college server and run:**
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/leave-portal/

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh

# Run the automated deployment (this does everything!)
sudo ./deploy-production.sh
```

The deployment script will automatically:
- ✅ Install PM2 if needed
- ✅ Detect your public IP
- ✅ Configure firewall rules
- ✅ Set up systemd service
- ✅ Create log directories
- ✅ Configure security settings

### **🗃️ STEP 4: Configure Database**

**Follow the script's instructions to set up MySQL:**
```sql
-- Login to MySQL
mysql -u root -p

-- Run these commands:
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS cyber_security_leave_portal;
CREATE USER 'leave_portal'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON cyber_security_leave_portal.* TO 'leave_portal'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;

-- Import the schema
mysql -u root -p cyber_security_leave_portal < rebuilt_schema.sql
```
