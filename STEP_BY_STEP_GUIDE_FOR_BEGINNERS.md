## üìã What You Need Before Starting

Before you begin, make sure you have these things:

### ‚úÖ **Required Software (Must Have)**
1. **Windows Computer** - Windows 10 or Windows Server
2. **Administrator Access** - You must be able to run programs "as administrator"
3. **Internet Connection** - To download software and detect your public IP
4. **Node.js** - Download from https://nodejs.org/ (get the LTS version)
5. **MySQL Database** - Download from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

### üìù **Information You'll Need**
- Your **Public IP Address** (the script will help find this)
- Your **MySQL Password** (you'll set this during MySQL installation)

---

## üéØ Step 1: Install Required Software

### **1.1 Install Node.js**
1. Go to https://nodejs.org/
2. Download the **LTS version** (usually the green button)
3. Run the downloaded file (.msi)
4. Click "Next" ‚Üí "Next" ‚Üí "Install" 
5. Wait for installation to complete
6. Click "Finish"

**‚úÖ Test if Node.js is installed:**
- Press `Windows Key + R`

2. **Right-click** on PowerShell
3. Choose **"Run as administrator"**
4. Click "Yes" if Windows asks permission

### **2.2 Navigate to Your Project**

- It will ask: "Use public IP (203.0.113.1)? Enter 'y' for yes, or type your preferred IP address"

**Choose your option:**
- Type `y` and press Enter to use your public IP (recommended for internet access)
- OR type your specific IP address if you know it

**The script will then:**
- ‚úÖ Check if Node.js is installed
- ‚úÖ Install PM2 (a tool to run your website 24/7)
- ‚úÖ Build your website files

- ‚úÖ Create management scripts
- ‚úÖ Create desktop shortcuts

### **3.3 Wait for Completion**
The script will show many messages. Wait until you see:
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS cyber_security_leave_portal;
```

```sql
CREATE USER 'leave_portal'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MySecurePassword123';
```

In PowerShell (still as administrator), type:
```powershell
mysql -u root -p cyber_security_leave_portal < rebuilt_schema.sql
```
- Enter your MySQL root password when asked
- Wait for it to complete (no error messages = success!)

### **4.4 Update Configuration File**
1. In your project folder, find the file called `.env.production`
2. Open it with Notepad
3. Find the line: `DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_mysql_password_here`
4. Change it to: `DB_PASSWORD=MySecurePassword123` (use your actual password)
5. Save the file

## üìä Understanding Your Setup

### **What Ports Does Your Website Use?**
- **Port 80:** This redirects to the main website (no port needed in URL)
- **Port 8085:** This is where the website actually runs
- **Port 3009:** This is where the backend API runs (for data)
- **Port 3307:** This is where MySQL database runs

### **What is PM2?**
PM2 is a tool that keeps your website running 24/7, even if there are errors or the computer restarts.

### **Where are the Website Files?**
- Main files: In your current folder (`\\192.168.46.89\d\Leave_portal`)
- Logs: In the `logs` folder
- Configuration: `.env.production` file

### **What is Your Public IP?**
Your public IP is the address that people from the internet use to access your server. The script automatically detects this.
